# Rationale

## Design

The Tombstone service is implemented as a Kafka Streams application to consume `KTable`'s source topics and capture keys and timestamps.
Based on these, there is a punctuator scheduled by configuration to evaluate key's timestamps and produce tombstone (`null` values) when TTL condition happens.
The frequency evaluation is based on event time, meaning only when new events arrive, the condition is evaluatedâ€”not happening on system wall clock.

Current Kafka Streams topology:

```text
Topologies:
   Sub-topology: 0
    Source: read-table-source (topics: [QUERYABLE_T1])
      --> process-ttl-checks
    Processor: process-ttl-checks (stores: [QUERYABLE_T1])
      --> write-tombstone-back
      <-- read-table-source
    Sink: write-tombstone-back (topic: QUERYABLE_T1)
      <-- process-ttl-checks
```

Where `QUERYABLE_T1` is the source topic name.

### Costs

Having this application deployed, means:

- Adding a Consumer of the KTable source topic, duplicating the consumption of events from the topic.
- A persisting key-value store is managed at the Kafka Streams instance. This will require storage relative to the key cardinality x (key size + timestamp size (`long` value)).
- Tombstone message will increase the source topic size.
